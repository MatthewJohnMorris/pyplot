Use Python to generate SVG files for plotter art

Installation

Just copy and use - no packaging as yet.

Usage
-----

You will need to have the following other packages installed 
* noise (for perlin stuff)
* pycairo (for text_wisth)
* opencv-python (for image reading and processing)
* svgwrite (for anything at all)

To do this, you can create a venv and install within that.
